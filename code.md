This web-site is underconstruction, the links to code and full descriptions will appear shortly.

## Filters
*    **Gaussian Filter** for smoothing electrophysiology data
*    **Okada Filter** for smoothing noise associated with a PMT

## Data Analysis
*    **Calcium Line-Scan Analysis** imports data from Olympus FV300 and calculates deltaG/R
*    **Non-Stationary Noise Analysis**
*    **Passive Membrane Properties** calcuates membrane properties based on model by XXX

## External Devices
*    **Motorized Microscope-Stage**
*    **Motorized Micromanipulator**
*    **Pressurized Perfusion System**
