subtitle: Mark W Sherwood, PhD
---
Mark Sherwood obtained his undergraduate degree in Medical Biochemistry from the University of Leicester (UK). In 2007 Mark was awarded a Ph.D from the University of Liverpool (UK), for his work on XXX. For his first postdoc Mark moved to the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan to learn electrophysiology and to study the role of IP3Rs in spike-time dependent synaptic plasticity. Along the way Mark switched to investigating the role of glia-neuron communications in synaptic plasticity. Misa Arizono, a PhD student at the time, made the seminal discovery of IP3R2 independent Ca2+ signalling in astrocytes. Mark built on this to demonstrate the regulation of gliotransmission and synaptic plasticity by neuronally evoked non-IP3R2 mediated astrocytic IP3-indiced Ca2+ Release.
