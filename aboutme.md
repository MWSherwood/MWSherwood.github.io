subtitle: Mark W Sherwood, PhD
---
Mark obtained his undergraduate degree in Medical Biochemistry from the University of Leicester (UK) and in 2007 was awarded a Ph.D from the University of Liverpool (UK), for his work on XXX. For his first postdoc he moved to the RIKEN Brain Science Institute (Japan) to learn electrophysiology and to study the role of IP3Rs in spike-time dependent synaptic plasticity. Along the way Mark switched to investigating the role of glia-neuron communications in synaptic plasticity. 

Misa Arizono, a PhD student at the time, made the seminal discovery of IP3R2 independent Ca2+ signalling in astrocytes. Mark built on this to demonstrate the regulation of gliotransmission and synaptic plasticity by neuronally evoked non-IP3R2 mediated astrocytic IP3-induced Ca2+ Release. To study the role of IP3R dependent gliotransmission in more depth Mark moved to the Oliet laboratory in Bordeaux. Working with Dr. Aude Panatier, Mark discovered a novel form of activity dependent gliotransmission.

In 2021 Mark moved to Kyoto (Japan) and joined the laboratory of Akiyuki Taruno to study taste perception. During his stay Mark implemented in vivo imaging of taste cells and developed mice lines expressing voltage and ATP sensors.

In 2024 Mark joined the team of Misa Aizono.
